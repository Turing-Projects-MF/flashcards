# FlashCards

This project is designed to help study front-end engineering by simulating flash cards through the command line.

### Goals

- Focusing on implementing ES6 classes
- Writing modular, reusable code that follows Single Responsibility Principle
- Implementing a robust testing suite using TDD

### Setup

- Clone down the flashcards repo (git@github.com:mdflynn/flashcards.git)

- CD into the directory that you cloned the repo into and run ```npm install```

- In your terminal, type ```node index.js``` to begin the gameplay

- You can type the number for the your answer or arrow up or down, then hit enter

- Once the game is over, you'll receive some feedback with how many you answered correct
